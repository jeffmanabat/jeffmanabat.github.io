  <h1>Unit 8: Critique</h1>
  <hr>
    <h2>Step 1: Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3></li>
            <p>I explored websites of many popular musical acts, even ones I don't necessarily enjoy, to see what information they showed, and how they presented that information. I was most inspired by: 
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.taylorwift.com">Taylor Swift</a>. Lots of content but never overwhelming, easy to navigate, engaging, beautiful imagery.</li>
              <li><a href="http://lorde.co.nz/">Lorde</a>. Very simple and social.</li>
              <li><a href="http://onedirection.com/">One Direction</a>. Lots of easily accessible images, and easily connects to other fans.</li> 
              <li>Acts with big touring schedules like <a href="http://ptxofficial.com/home">Pentatonix</a> and <a href="www.madonna.com">Madonna</a>. Calendar dates and how to get tickets are on the front page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>A few websites unrelated to music that inspire me:</p> 
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> for its elegant, clean, accessible, clutter-free design.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.vox.com">Vox</a> for its curated news that looks great to read on any device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>My takeaways from these design inspirations: 
            <ul>
              <li>Use lots of big, high-quality images.</li>
              <li>Prioritize social media and calendar.</li>
              <li>Keep the design elegant and free from clutter.</li>
              <li>Make information accessible and beautiful to read.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
        <li><h3>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3></li>
          <p>The fact that I have built a website at all makes me proud. I knew nothing about HTML or CSS before this class. It astonishes me that I used that foreign language to create a <a href="http://jeffmanabat.github.io/Unit6/index.html">site for a client</a>, and now am preparing to create a <a href="http://jeffmanabat.github.io/Unit8/index.html">site for my group</a>.</p>
        <li><h3>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3></li>
          <p>Even when I know what information to present, there is still so many choices to make: colors, fonts, sizes, images, flow… it all matters! Both the content and presentation of that content are of equal importance.</p>
        <li><h3>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h3></li>
          <p>I still struggle with floats, columns, wrappers. The page I presented for Unit 7 took much longer than I thought it would, but eventually I figured out how to make it work the way I wanted.</p>
      <li><h3>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h3></li>
          <p>Scalable websites matter. Mobile is the future, and websites must incorporate that into their design in order to reach a wider audience.</p>
      </ul>
    <h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><h3>Group 1 - <a href="http://squarespace.com/home/overview/">squarespace.com</a></h3></li>
          <p>The layout of this site is very flexible and thus looks attractive on small, medium, and large screens. Instead of using contrasting serif and sans serif type, this site uses only sans serif, and any serif type we see belong to the website examples. It’s an effective choice, keeping the information about Squarespace easily identifiable when next to information found on the sample pages. Navigation is very elegant, as the information I want is easy to find, and overall flow encourages exploration of the various websites showcased on the site.</p>
      <li><h3>Group 2 - <a href="http://mimarch.net/">mimarch.net</a></h3></li>
          <p>This website has a difficult layout. The front page has a confusing array of giant images, tiny misspelled text is repeated in various unrelated spaces, and the nav bar seems to be spread out unevenly. The type gets lost in the bizarre layout. But even when found, the font choices seem safe at best, and unappealing at worst. Navigation is almost impossible and there is no comfortable flow of information. Amazingly, the site looks better on small screens, but the text is still far too small to comfortably read.</p>
        </ul>
