                <br><br>

                <p>In this brilliant reality send-up, we find Rachel, Winnie, Trixie and Trampolina in the jungle, trying their best to score at challenges that involve singing, dancing, dating, dieting and, of course, large insects.</p>

                <br>

                <p> The Kinsey Sicks were, in fact, contestants in Season 3 of "America's Got Talent." Their first performances brought standing ovations from the audience and gushing praise from both Sharon Osbourne and Piers Morgan - the only thing they agreed on that year. A Kinsey Sicks performance was even used as the Season 3 trailer. However, once show producers caught wind of the Kinseys' brand of politics, flavor of humor, and personal hygiene, THE KINSEY SICKS were cheerfully shown the door, and the performance footage was left on the cutting room floor.</p>

                <br>

                <p>"AMERICA'S NEXT TOP BACHELOR HOUSEWIFE CELEBRITY HOARDER MAKEOVER STAR GONE WILD!" brings the group's firsthand knowledge of the reality show experience to bear, poking fun at the genre's blatant manipulation of contestants and audience alike - but, of course, all in effortless 4-part harmony! This show boasts some of the group's best music - wicked parodies and objectionable originals - plus brilliant new songs about the ethics of stardom.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>Be amazed (or appalled) by The Kinsey Sicks' latest and greatest dragtastic a cappella musical! This collection of new songs is an equal mix of appalling original songs and unforgiveable parodies of such favorites as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; A Whole New World; What Does the Fox Say; a Carol King number; two Grammy-award winning hits: Happy and the Disney sensation Let it Go; and of course, The Gershwin classic I’ve Got Plenty o' Nuttin'. In other words, this show has something to mortify everyone!</p> 

                <br>

                <p>PLUS, the audience has the special privilege to shape the show for the next audience! That's right, it's up to YOU to determine which songs are so outstandingly bad that the next audience should not see them! Come enjoy the show, and judge whether a song lives or dies!</p>

              <h5>OY VEY IN A MANGER!</h5>

                <div id="About">

                <img src="images/OyVey.jpg" alt="Electile Dysfunction" title="Electile Dysfunction" style="max-width:100%">

                <br><br>

                <p>In this hilarious holiday dragstravaganza, we find Rachel, Winnie, Trixie, and Trampolina trying to sell off their manger - yes, that manger - before it's foreclosed upon. Crises arise, secrets are revealed, Jewish-Gentile tensions surface, and mayhem ensues… all in glorious four-part harmony!</p>

                <br>

                <p>The show boasts The Kinsey Sicks reinterpretations of holiday classics, such as "God Bless Ye Femmy Lesbians," "Satan Baby", and "I'm Dreaming of a Betty White Christmas", plus hilarious Jewish satiric fare, including "Don't Be Happy, Worry," the Chanukah spa classic "I Had a Little Facial" and, of course, the requisite and new Christmas cuisine standard, "Soylent Night."</p>

                <br>

                <p>The Washington Post says: <em>"In an ecumenical display of wicked joie de vivre, the Kinsey Sicks are sending up everything that's holy in “Oy Vey in a Manger,” a raunchily audacious declaration that nothing about the holidays is sacred… If you haven't made the acquaintance of the Kinsey Sicks, it's high time you did."</em></p>

                <p><em>Sometimes it's hard being a Republican.</em></p>

                <br>

                <p>Join the Kinsey Sicks for the official re-launch of their groundbreaking campaign to become the first Dragapella Beautyshop Quartet to serve as President of the United States and Leader of the Free World.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Watch as the gals take (a)back America by out-pandering, out-conspiracy theorizing, and out-outlandishing even the most cynical of the current crop of Presidential candidates, all in glorious four-part harmony.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The Washington Post says: "The songs are marvels...pun-filled and sung in four-part harmony - a cappella, let's remember - with a good deal of wit in the arrangements." The Washington City Paper says: "This isn't, let's note, just innocent political buffoonery. Often a joke that starts out mild ("The 'moderate' in 'moderate Republican' is silent, like the 'p' in 'psoriasis'") will end up having a surprisingly pointed kicker ("...or the 'Judeo' in 'Judeo-Christian.'"). The Maryland Theatre Guide acclaims "[the] group's signature tight harmonies" and gives Electile five stars out of five.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The Kinsey Sicks were commissioned to write "Electile Dysfunction" by our good friends at Washington DC's Theater J, where the piece premiered in February 2012. Watch the calendar for its arrival at a campaign whistle stop near you!</p>
