									<p>"The Kinsey Sicks dazzled a sold out audience ...The Kinsey Sicks have an original premise and sharp writing skills. There was nary a moment when the audience wasn’t roaring with laughter. The Kinsey Sicks take jokes to the extreme and they occasionally go too far, but that’s the point: to strike nerves and to jolt beliefs, all in seamless harmony. Their cleverly apt expressions and surprising puns, coupled with their contemporary pop culture references from Honey Boo-Boo to the Ferguson, MO grand jury decision, the Kinsey Sicks are not afraid to sprinkle acerbic cultural and religious criticism into their show... Impressive? Absolutely. Fiercely feminist, flamboyant, flashy and intensely intelligent, the Kinsey Sicks offer a refreshing and absolutely hilarious brand of entertainment."</p>

								<li class="cd-testimonials-item">
									<p>"Looking like they’d just stepped out of a saccharine-infused 50’s sitcom, the Kinseys proved that looks can be very deceptive as they sardonically satirised the jaded culture of reality TV and that vacuous modern day need that some people have, to achieve five minutes of ‘fame’ at any cost. We joined them in the jungle and followed their own reality hell, trying to succeed at challenges that involve singing, dancing, dating, dieting and large insects. Wonderfully crude and exceptionally clever parodies with intricate wordplay and performance style were served up as a capella four part harmonies that dazzled. The girls work together expertly, with fluid dialogue and seamless delivery. At times I found myself wondering if any of the vocal gymnastics were actually coming from another backing source, such was the standard of quality."</p>

									<p>"For connoisseurs of gender-bending comedy who find Dame Edna too tame, the Kinsey Sicks up the ante in Dragapella -- quadrupling the outlandish feminine allure while boosting it with considerable vocal skills and a grab bag of outrageous, often naughty, musical numbers... over-the-top silliness...hilarious...lyrics clever enough for Ira Gershwin or E.Y. Harburg." </p>
