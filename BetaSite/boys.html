                          <p style="text-align:left">Lyric baritone Nathan Marken is tickled pink to drop the bass with the Kinsey Sicks, having first been exposed to them in the early-mid 2000s as a young music student. A native of Illinois,Nathan is currently based in San Francisco, where he has performed the notable roles of the Emcee at The Speakeasy and the title role in Hedwig and the Angry Inch (Boxcar Theatre), Devil Boys from Beyond (Mattie van Buren) and Xanadu (Thalia) at the New Conservatory Theatre Center, The Rocky Horror Show (Brad), Le Nozze di Figaro (Bartolo) with Opera on Tap:SF, and Insignificant Others (Andrew) at Pier 39. Nathan holds a Masters of Music from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and is a graduate of the Illinois Wesleyan University School of Music. Nathan has previously served on the Board of Directors of the Lesbian Gay Chorus of San Francisco as its Treasurer.</p><br>

                          <hr>
                          <br>
                          <p style="text-align:left">While an undergraduate at Harvard College, Ben was torn between pursuing a career as a gay activist and a career in theater. Eventually he decided that activism was more important and that he didn't have the talent to be a performer. Ben went on to attend Harvard Law School and, upon graduation, started the first national AIDS legal program. He later served as Executive Director of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association and was appointed to President Clinton's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. Eventually Ben discovered that (a) activism and theater are not mutually exclusive; (b) talent is overrated; and (c) making people laugh is much more fun than suing them, and no less effective in making them think. As chief lyricist for The Kinsey Sicks, Ben is largely irresponsible for the lyrics that have made tens of thousands cringe.</p><br>

                          <br>
                          <p style="text-align:left">Jeff originated the lead role of Henry Tahara in the critically acclaimed play Bronzeville, nominated for both an NAACP Theatre Award and Ovation Award, with Robey Theater Company in Los Angeles. Favorite stage credits: Oberon/Theseus (A Midsummer Night's Dream), Lun Tha (The King and I), Agrippa (Cleopatra: the Musical). Previous a cappella experience includes singing with, writing for, and directing the UC Men's Octet from the University of California at Berkeley, which won first place at the National Competition of Collegiate A Cappella held at Carnegie Hall. He joined The Kinseys in 2004, where he continues to write many of the vocal arrangements and is responsible for the entire group’s hot couture.</p><br>

                          <hr>
                          <br>
                          <p style="text-align:left">Spencer, a Kansas City-based performer, is a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York and joined the Kinsey Sicks in 2008. His other alter ego Daisy Buckët has won various honors including 2008 Best Cabaret Show (The Pitch), Queen of Kansas City Pride 2008, and 2011's Best Drag Performer (The Pitch). Favorite credits include writing and starring in a stage adaptation of the film The Rose, Riff Raff (The Rocky Horror Show), Snow White (Grimm & Bare It), Chicklet (Psycho Beach Party), and Sue Snell (A Scarrie Carrie Christmas Carol). He's enjoyed performing all over Kansas City at venues such as the Unicorn Theatre, Union Station, the Folly Theater, Late Night Theatre, Off Center Theatre, and the Just Off Broadway Theater (nearly all of them in drag!). Spencer's work for local HIV/AIDS organizations has raised over $80,000 with his annual AIDS Walk team, Team Buckët. When he's not singing and mugging shamelessly as Trampolina, he can be found donning a blonde wig as Daisy at Hamburger Mary's and Missie B's.</p>
