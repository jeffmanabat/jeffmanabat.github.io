        <h3>Winnie</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Winnie sees herself as an old-fashioned girl, and yearns for the days before the Great Vowel Shift. For relaxation, she enjoys mah jongg, macrame and alphabetizing her recipes. Winnie briefly headed up a lesbian separatist clogger troupe, but found it too arduous to clean the footprints off her antique dhurrie rugs. Winnie is currently awaiting publication of her new Passover cookbook entitled <em>I Can't Believe It's Not Chometz!</em></p>

        <h3>Rachel</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Rachel caught her first break in show business as a masseuse for John Travolta. With John's help, and the assistance of a legally-binding confidentiality agreement, Rachel landed a starring role in the national tour of "Two Girls One Cup: The Musical", with co-star Ann Coulter. Now that she is with The Kinsey Sicks, Rachel has gone viral, but she is taking acyclovir. Rachel will soon be the host of a new TV show, "Pole Dancing with the Stars, " on Fox.</p>

        <h3>Trixie</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">During her rare moments of leisure, Trixie can be found at Tiffany and Bergdorf's in the company of handsome (and generous) gentlemen. She has never married, and is addressed simply as "Trixie". As she has reminded her less glamourous Kinsey colleagues, great ladies of the stage and screen (Beyonce, Madonna, Lassie) find surnames superfluous.</p>

        <h3>Trampolina</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left"> When she's not touring with The Kinsey Sicks and carrying all nine pieces of Trixie's luggage, Trampolina spends most of her days in a trailer park outside of Belton, Missouri waiting for Maury Povich to call her and tell her she IS the mother of a bastard child she conceived one spring break in Cancun.</p>
